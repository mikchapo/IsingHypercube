This repo contains c++ code for generating variably sized lattices of the Toric Code, and for loading the lattices into a 
python program which uses machine learning to recognize the phase transition.

Setup that needs to be done after cloning:
-make a param.dat file in MonteCarlo, following the format given at the beginning of simparam.h
-create data folder
  -before generating lattices a folder needs to be created in data named after the appropriate parameters, following the format
   TC-D#-L##-Raw
-compile IsingMonteCarlo.cpp
